# Football-Analytics
Hey guys! If you are reading this right now, it can only mean you are starting your journey in football analytics. This repository will contain all basic concepts in football such as plotting shots, pass maps, heat maps, etc. I'll be using open statsbomb data throughout this repository.

Even though there are packages in python such as mplscocer etc to make things easy for us, it's a basic requirment to know what happens exactly and how things are done.

I've tried to make things easy and simple to understand. But the secret behind learning everything is to experiment and try on your own. Play with the code and understand why it's done. All the best!
